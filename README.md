# Becomics

This is a back end that will help me learn about front end development. Most code generated by Phoenix.
It is possible to insert into the tables with:

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"comic": {"name":"Megatokyo","url":"http://megatokyo.com"}}' http://localhost:4000/api/comics

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"publish": {"day":"Mon","comic_id":"ee9515cd-e016-4c98-8818-27997eaef4b9"}}' http://localhost:4000/api/publishes

where comic_id is 'id' in the reply to the first post.

Phoenix made it very easy to add a basic front end so it is possible to visit [`localhost:4000/daily`](http://localhost:4000/daily) to see todays comics.


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
